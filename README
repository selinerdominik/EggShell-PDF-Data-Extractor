What is EggShell PDF Data Extractor?
-------------

EggShell PDF Extraction is an opensource tool used in EggShell for extracting
data from PDF files. It is based on XPDF which can be downloaded
here: http://www.foolabs.com/xpdf/

Xpdf runs under the X Window System on UNIX and OS/2.  The non-X
components (pdftops, pdftotext, etc.) also run on Windows and Mac OSX
systems and should run on pretty much any system with a decent C++
compiler.  Xpdf will run on 32-bit and 64-bit machines.


License & Distribution
----------------------

EggShell PDF Extraction is licensed under the GNU General Pulbic License (GPL), version 2
or 3.  This means that you can distribute derivatives of Xpdf under
any of the following:
  - GPL v2 only
  - GPL v3 only
  - GPL v2 or v3

The EggShell PDF Data Extractor source package includes the text of both GPL versions:
COPYING for GPL v2, COPYING3 for GPL v3.

Please note that EggShell PDF Data Extractor is NOT licensed under "any later version" of the
GPL, as I have no idea what those versions will look like.

If you are redistributing unmodified copies of EggShell PDF Data Extractor (or any of the
EggShell PDF Data Extractor tools) in binary form, you need to include all of the
documentation: README, man pages (or help files), COPYING, and
COPYING3.

If you want to incorporate the EggShell PDF Data Extractor source code into another program
(or create a modified version of EggShell PDF Data Extractor), and you are distributing that
program, you have two options: release your program under the GPL (v2
and/or v3), or purchase a commercial EggShell PDF Data Extractor source license.

If you're interested in commercial licensing, please see the Glyph &
Cog web site:

Compatibility
-------------

EggShell PDF Data Extractor is developed and tested on Linux.

In addition, it has been compiled by others on Solaris, AIX, HP-UX,
Digital Unix, Irix, and numerous other Unix implementations, as well
as OS/2.  It should work on pretty much any system which runs X11 and
has Unix-like libraries.  You'll need ANSI C++ and C compilers to
compile it.

The non-X components of EggShell PDF Data Extractor (pdftops, pdftotext, pdfinfo, pdffonts,
pdfdetach, pdftoppm, and pdfimages) can also be compiled on Windows
and Mac OSX systems.  See the Xpdf web page for details.
